# Why did I start this blog?

I am a person who is super addicted to the 'meaning' of everything. In other words, I cannot move on to the next page without understanding'why' or 'how' of the concept. No exception. 
For example, when I was elementary school student, I sticked to the necessity of sum, subset, multiple, division. 
All of my friends just summed or divided numbers that they got from teacher, but I couldn't. Since I could not understand what is those tools, why I need to use those tools in my life. 
My mom explained me like that ; - it was just an assistance for some litte girl who did not even started her assignment - 



>"You need to divide these 3 cookies with your 3 friends including you. 
>That is why you need to learn division!"
(Sorry, mom. When I heard this from you, my head just filled with chocolatechip cookies...) 



As time went by, I slowly but deeply understood the concepts I learned in school, and I realized that way of studying was fit for me and 
very effective and successful in a long term in my life. 

Hum Hum. Introduction was long.(right, I need to explain why I am writing this post!! ) 




Hello, I am Soi Cho who studying Business Analytics in UT Dallas. I am studying R, Python, MySQL, and Tableau and I'm kinda skillful at SAP and Excel. 
But, the thing is this.

__need__

I cannot be satisfied just with the fact that 

_"Because I am skillful!"_
:sunglasses::sunglasses::sunglasses:


(too bragging? TBH..)


_"Because there are many job demands requiring those tools and I need to get a job to earn my living expense!"_
:money_mouth_face::money_mouth_face::money_mouth_face:



It is not enough.
I want to know 
"Why business analytics"
"How business analytics"



That's why I started this blog. To understand more deeply by posting regularly, to share what I understood with people.
I want to post not only codes and skills I learned but explain the meaning and how can we use in ourlive easily!
Hope to help everyone, cause BA is too broad and life is too short, right?
I believe that this blog can lead me to find out my road in Business Analytics area. 




My next posting is 

### "What is cybersecurity?"
